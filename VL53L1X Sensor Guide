Requirements:
Download MicroPython modules
We will need three files to easily read data from the Distance Sensor:

Download the PiicoDev Unified Library: PiicoDev_Unified.py (right-click, "save link as").
Download the device module: PiicoDev_VL53L1X.py (right-click, "save link as")
Download the example script: main.py (right-click, "save link as")
It will be best to keep these files wherever you like to keep your coding projects eg. Documents > PiicoDev
